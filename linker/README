This directory contains linker related stuff gathered while I was researching
linker hacks. Refer to <avd.reduct.ru/programming/restrict-memory.html#Linker>.


-> Default and modified (shifted `.data` section) scripts:

- default.lst
- hack.lst

-> Process maps (/proc/<pid>/maps) before and after allocations of normal
binary `big_alloc` and modified `big_alloc`:

- big_alloc_maps_before
- big_alloc_maps_after
- big_alloc_linker_maps_before
- big_alloc_linker_maps_after


-> Trace of memory accesses (`strace -e trace=memory`) of normal and modified
binaries:

- big_alloc.trace
- big_alloc_linker.trace

-> Exact command to build program (invocation of `cc1`, `as` and `collect2`):

- verbose
